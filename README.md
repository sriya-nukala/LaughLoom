# LaughLoom

The website, powered by Node.js and Express.js and utilizing the Axios library for backend operations, offers users a diverse and engaging experience centered around humor. With HTML and CSS employed for frontend design, users gain access to the Jokes API, a publicly accessible repository of jokes. 

Featuring jokes from six different languages, including single-line and two-part varieties, the website caters to a wide audience. 

Further enhancing user interaction, the website categorizes jokes into six distinct categories: Miscellaneous, Spooky, Programming, Dark, Christmas, and Pun. This categorization allows users to effortlessly navigate and discover jokes aligned with their preferences. 

Additionally, users have the flexibility to customize their browsing experience by selecting the number of jokes they wish to display. Behind the scenes, the server dynamically interacts with the Jokes API upon user submission, fetching jokes based on the specified filters.

In cases where no matching jokes are found, the server gracefully communicates this to the user, ensuring a seamless and informative experience. 

Overall, the website delivers a delightful and customizable joke-browsing experience, seamlessly blending backend operations with frontend presentation to offer users a memorable visit filled with laughter.
